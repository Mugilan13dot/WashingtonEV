## Background  
As the push for greener transportation gains momentum, understanding the EV landscape helps stakeholders from policymakers to automakers make informed decisions. This project aims to answer key questions around EV ownership patterns, top-performing brands, and geographic hotspots within Washington state.

Data was sourced from Washington’s Department of Licensing EV dataset and visualized using Tableau to ensure an interactive, insightful experience.

## Objectives  
This dashboard seeks to explore:

- ⚡ What are the most popular EV types in Washington?
- 🚘 Which EV brands dominate the market?
- 🌍 Which counties and postcodes have the highest EV ownership?
- 📅 How has EV adoption evolved year by year?

## Tools I Used  
🧰 Here's the tech stack behind the dashboard:

- **Tableau Public**: For crafting visually engaging and interactive dashboards.  
- **Excel/CSV**: Data preparation and cleaning before visualization.  
- **Mapbox**: Embedded for geographic data visualization.  
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project repository.

## The Analysis  

### 🔄 Vehicle Type Distribution  
The donut chart shows the split between:
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**  
- **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**  
BEVs make up the majority of EVs in the state, indicating a strong shift toward fully electric mobility.
